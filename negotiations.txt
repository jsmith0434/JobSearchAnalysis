1. **Introduction**
   - Briefly introduce the context: securing a federal government job and the structured, non-negotiable pay grades system.

3. **The Original Offer and My Experience**
   - Share the details of the original offer at **Step 1** and what it meant for your salary.
   - Lay out your credentials: an MS degree, 4 years of experience (exceeding the 1-year requirement), a strong academic record (4.0 GPA), and relevant graduate coursework.
   - Emphasize how these factors should have qualified you for a higher step from the start.

4. **The Negotiation Process**

     - Discuss the salary benchmarks from Robert Half for this job title and geographic area.
   - Mention that you compiled all this evidence into an email, attached supporting documents (transcripts, compensation summary, job offer, industry report), and made your case clearly.

5. **The Outcome: Step 10 Offer**
   - Share the result: the offer was adjusted from Step 1 to Step 10, a significant pay increase.

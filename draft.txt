**Title: Bummer Summer: Navigating the Worst Tech Job Market in 20 Years**

### 1. **Introduction**

We all know what a roller coaster the past few years have been, particularly for those working in tech. We went from record-breaking salaries to hiring freezes and layoffs, all within a matter of months. 2023 saw the second-highest number of tech layoffs on record, surpassed only by the dot-com crash in 2001. While hiring in other sectors has remained resilient, the current tech job market is considered by many to be the worst since the turn of the century. Worse still, the hiring climate seems to be hitting new college graduates and junior-level candidates the hardest.

The impact of these layoffs has led to an influx of tech workers applying for a smaller number of open roles. Couple this with the immensely unpopular return-to-office mandates imposed by many large employers, and just about everyone is looking for a new job. This has led to increased competition for fewer roles, and salaries and perks appear to be on the decline. Employers can afford to be pickier, and the interview process has become longer and more complex. Multiple rounds of technical interviews have become the norm, along with take-home assignments that are so complex some have speculated they’re a way for companies to get free work.

In short, this job market has been a nightmare for tech workers. We’re being forced to consider worse opportunities for much lower pay and face stiff competition. Employers are taking advantage of the situation with unreasonable interview timelines, requirements, and salaries that are much lower than what would have been offered just a year or two ago. AI resume screeners have become the norm, creating a positive feedback loop where it's easy to apply to hundreds of jobs, but employers end up sorting through thousands of candidates for each vacancy. Many of these vacancies may not even be ‘real’ jobs, with some companies admittedly posting positions they have no intention of filling, just to build a candidate pool they may or may not use in the future.

All of this has created an incredibly frustrating environment for job seekers. I tracked my experience looking for a new job for three months, aiming to take a more data-driven approach to the process. Here are the key findings from my analysis.

### 2. **Bad Behavior**

Over a three-month period, I applied for close to 450 jobs. Out of all these applications, I had a success rate of around 3%, with “success” being defined as an invitation for an initial interview. The result of all my efforts was 17 positive contacts in response to my applications. Three of these weren’t interview requests but instead 90+ minute tech screen invitations as the first point of contact. When I followed up with a recruiter to ask why anyone would think this was a reasonable expectation before even making a phone call, I was told they needed to narrow down their candidate pool to a more reasonable number to conserve HR resources. So, they sent out the tech screen to over 60 candidates. I have no idea how many they actually intended to interview based on the results.

I even had one company request that every applicant record a video of themselves answering interview questions. They claimed this was to reduce bias in the hiring process and was actually a benefit to candidates. However, if I wasn’t comfortable with that, it would be the end of my candidacy. One interview revealed that a position, advertised as an internship but requiring 3-4 years of experience, was actually unpaid. When I followed up with questions about expected hours, mentorship, and whether equity was offered, I couldn’t get a direct answer—and never heard back from the interviewer.

Of all the 450 jobs, 74% never responded at all. That’s 3/4 of companies I took the time to apply to that never bothered to inform me of the outcome. Out of the ~100 official 'No thank you' responses I received, eight positions ended up being canceled or put on hold.

Out of all those job applications, I received 17 positive responses, moved forward to the interview stage with 13 companies, and ultimately landed one job offer. Unfortunately, I declined this offer for several reasons. For one, it was at least $30k below the market rate and $80k below the salary I made in my previous role. However, money isn't everything, and had it not been for some major red flags, I might have considered it. The HR person handling my offer was incredibly pushy, and the hiring manager insulted my qualifications within the first five minutes of my interview. The 'confidentiality agreement' (which I had a lawyer review) would have given the company rights over all IP created at any point before or after the contract was signed—by either myself or my heirs—in perpetuity.

So yes, employers have been behaving very, very badly. However, all is not lost. There were a few key takeaways from my analysis that can help in finding ways to more efficiently focus your time and energy while navigating this job market.

### 3. **Job Boards Matter**

LinkedIn is, by far, the easiest and most popular way to find and apply for positions. Over 1/3 of my applications were sent through LinkedIn, but only two of my interview invitations came from those applications—a less than 2% return rate. If you don’t already know, for jobs that you apply to through the 'Easy Apply' feature, you can check to see if your application has been viewed. Each application will have a status indicator next to it, which can include: Applied (your initial submission) and Viewed (the employer has seen your application). 

When I discovered this feature, I didn’t believe it at first, because I had to scroll pretty far through my history to find an application that had actually been viewed. Despite applying for jobs that were, on average, less than two days old, hardly any of my LinkedIn applications were ever even viewed by a real person.

Out of all the job boards I used, I found that applications submitted to Built In and Remote Rocketship had the highest success rates.

### 4. **Resume Customization is Overrated**

The prevailing advice is to customize your resume for each position you apply to. With this in mind, I set a goal of a 30% customization rate. I tried a few paid AI services but found them laughably ineffective, and they didn’t really save much time. For instance, one tool added fabricated metrics into my work experience, like claiming I “increased sales by 20%” at a previous employer (that would have been the equivalent of single-handedly increasing revenue by billions of dollars). I ended up using Overleaf’s LaTeX editor and manually updating my skills and job responsibilities based on each job description. I maintained a customization rate of over 30% for the first month and a half, but it became exhausting. Eventually, I slowed down and went back to relying on four or five resumes customized for general job titles and descriptions.

What I found was that putting in all that extra effort to customize my resume didn’t make a difference in whether I received an interview invite. I even did a statistical analysis to validate that conclusion, and it confirmed there is no significant difference in performance between the customized and non-customized resume groups.

### 5. **Self-Confidence is Underrated**

I have about four years of experience in analytics and engineering and applied to a wide range of job titles that fall under the data science umbrella. In my experience, jobs that include the word “analyst” are usually less technical and pay less than those ending in “scientist” or “engineer.” My academic background positions me well for one of those science or engineering jobs, but my work experience has included more of an analyst-level scope. Because of this, I felt comfortably qualified for junior to mid-level analytics engineer and data analyst roles, while data science and data engineering opportunities felt like more of a stretch. I also felt overqualified for business analyst opportunities, which tend to be even less technical than data analyst positions, but I applied for these roles anyway. You can see in the breakdown of the types of roles I applied to that I focused most of my energy on job titles where I thought I was a stronger candidate.

Did the success rate of my applications mirror my self-assessment? No, it did not. I was offered interviews for data science and data engineer positions at a higher rate than for data analyst roles, which I had considered myself more qualified for and therefore spent the most time applying to. In fact, there seemed to be no correlation between how I rated my qualifications for a job title and how often I got an interview relative to how many applications I submitted. I may have been shooting myself in the foot by applying to fewer data science and engineering jobs because I lacked confidence in my skills.

### 6. **What I Learned**

Between searching for opportunities, tailoring resumes, applying, networking, interviewing, and prepping, I estimate that I spent 20-30 hours per week on my job search over three months. In the end, all of this resulted in one job offer, which I declined.

In a twist of fate, there was a second offer I received that is not accounted for in this analysis. I applied for a data science position with the federal government in May, was called for an interview 4.5 months later in September, and after one 30-minute call with the hiring manager (which I thought I bombed), I got a job offer the next business day. It looks like my future job was out there the whole time, and I'm convinced this is one example where no data set could have predicted this outcome.

The experience of interviewing is valuable, but I still struggle with confidence and have trouble articulating my skills and abilities. The nightmare of looking for a job in this industry, even as someone with experience, has been incredibly time-consuming and emotionally draining. While my journey on this path is finally coming to an end, I hope the insights from my experience help others make more informed decisions on how to best use their time and energy.

Let this be a lesson: you never know when doors will open for you. Keep your head up, keep trying, and stay positive. It’s tough, but it won’t last forever. And if you can avoid it, never take a bad offer. If you see red flags, don’t ignore them! Companies may have the upper hand right now, but that doesn’t mean you should compromise on what’s important to you. If it’s a bad fit, keep looking—other opportunities will come along. Never be afraid to put yourself out there, and always remind yourself of your worth. And for the final hot takeaway, stay off LinkedIn, apply for jobs you think are a stretch, and don't customize your resume!
